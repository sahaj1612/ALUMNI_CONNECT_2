## Setup

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sahaj1612/ALUMNI_CONNECT.git
cd ALUMNI_CONNECT
```

Install backend dependencies:

```bash
cd backend
npm install
```

Install frontend dependencies:

```bash
cd ../frontend
npm install
```

## Environment Variables

Create `backend/.env` from `backend/.env.example`:

```env
PORT=5000
MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/alumniConnectDB
JWT_SECRET=change-me-in-production
CLIENT_URL=http://localhost:5173
CLIENT_URLS=http://localhost:5173,http://127.0.0.1:5173
ADMIN_ID=admin@sdmcet.edu
ADMIN_PASSWORD=Admin@1234
```

Create `frontend/.env` from `frontend/.env.example` if you need to override the API URL:

```env
VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:5000/api
```

## Run Locally

Start the backend:

```bash
cd backend
npm run dev
```

Start the frontend in another terminal:

```bash
cd frontend
npm run dev
```

Default local URLs:

- Frontend: `http://localhost:5173`
- Backend API: `http://localhost:5000/api`
- Health check: `http://localhost:5000/api/health`

## Build Frontend

```bash
cd frontend
npm run build
```

## Start Backend

```bash
cd backend
npm start
```

## Default Login Accounts

### Student

- USN: `2SD24CS075`
- Email: `sahaj.ssh16@gmail.com`
- Password: `1234`

### Alumni

- Email: `sahaj.ssh16@gmail.com`
- Password: `1234`

### Administrator (only one account)

- Admin ID: `admin@sdmcet.edu`
- Password: `Admin@1234`

The administrator account is configured through `ADMIN_ID` and `ADMIN_PASSWORD` in `backend/.env`; it is not stored as a MongoDB record, so no additional admin accounts can be created. Change these values before production deployment.

## Important Routes

### Public Pages

- `/` - Homepage

## Backend Notes

- Main server file: `backend/server.js`
- App configuration: `backend/src/app.js`
- API routes are mounted under `/api`.
- Uploaded files are stored under `backend/uploads`.
- Runtime uploads are ignored by Git to avoid committing user files.

## API Overview

## Notes

- Keep `JWT_SECRET` private in production.

- Make sure MongoDB is running before starting the backend.
